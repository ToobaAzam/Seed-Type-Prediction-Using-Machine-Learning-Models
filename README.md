Led a project to predict seed types using machine learning techniques as part of the Artificial Intelligence
course curriculum. Processed and analyzed agricultural data using Python, pandas, and numpy, uncovering 
correlations and trends. Implemented a Naive Bayes classifier to predict seed types based on features like
compactness and kernel dimensions, achieving an accuracy of 100% in the test data. Additionally, developed 
a perceptron model, achieving an accuracy of 33.33%. Presented findings to peers and instructors,
demonstrating the effectiveness of the models in seed type classification.


Results:
The accuracy of the Naive Bayesian method on the test set(15%) is 100%. I would like to
mention that when the test data is increased then the accuracy is decreased. On the other hand,
the accuracy of the Perceptron on the test set is 33.33%. Here, one important thing is to note that
perceptron works well on binary classification but the dataset that I have chosen has a multiclass
value. For this, I have to reshape the data and that affects the performance of the perceptron.
